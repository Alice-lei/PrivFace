# PrivFace
We aim to devise a faster privacy-preserving face authentication scheme with the revocability and reusability functions (without time-consuming cryptographic operations). 

After our research paper is published, we plan to make the relevant codes open-source to the community for further research.

In addition, in our previous study [1], we have used additively homomorphic encryption and secret sharing to construct a revocable and reusable face authentication scheme without the help of a trusted third party.
