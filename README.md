# PrivFace
We aim to devise a faster privacy-preserving face authentication scheme with the revocability and reusability functions (without time-consuming cryptographic operations). 

## Setup
Our scheme is implemented in JAVA using Android Studio.

## Dataset
3,000 pairs of data of highly compact 160-dimensional vectors that contain rich identity information are used as a test set, which has marked indicating whether a pair of data belongs to the same person.

## 










In addition, in our previous study [1], we have used additively homomorphic encryption and secret sharing to construct a revocable and reusable face authentication scheme without the help of a trusted third party.
