We adopt the popular CASIA-WebFace database from Center for Biometrics and Security Research, which contains 10,575 subjects and 494,414 images. 

The DeepID is exploited as the feature extraction algorithm through deep learning. 

3000 pairs data of highly compact 160-dimensional vectors that contain rich identity information are used as a test set, which has marked indicating whether a pair of data belongs to the same person.
